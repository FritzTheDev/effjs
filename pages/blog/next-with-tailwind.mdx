### Intro:
**Welcome to the inagural post of EffJs**, the blog where I teach how to be a more effective JS Dev! We'll cover anything and everything I find interesting in Javascript, with topics across the stack and for a variety of skill levels. -
*Expect new posts every Wednesday from here on out!*


### Step 1: Setting Up A Basic Next.js App
Let's get started by creating a new Next app. There are a couple good ways to do this, but we're going to stick with doing it from scratch.
This tutorial assumes you have a recent version of Yarn package manager installed & a basic grasp of React. NPM will do the job in place of yarn, you'll just have to translate a couple of the commands used.

First, create a new directory to contain the project & cd into it, then run...
```sh

yarn init -y
yarn add react react-dom next
mkdir pages
```

Once you've created the project, added a pages directory, & installed the bare-minimum packages for your Next.js app, we're ready to get started!
