### Node/Postgres/Typescript Contact List API
<a className="pl-3 text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/Rapdash/contact-api-project">This API</a> is a project I completed last January as part of an interview at Clickup, a San Diego startup in the productivity space. (Highly recommend their app, by the way.)

The server acts as a backend for an imaginary contact list app. I'm particularly proud of this one because I built it in ~6 hours with unfamiliar tools (notably, raw SQL queries as opposed to my typical ORM). It pushed my ability to work well under pressure and I'm very happy with how it turned out.

The API includes endpoints for auth, users, user groups, & contacts. Thinking about adding a test suite but it's not a priority right now.

### 6° Credit Union CRM
I worked at 6°, a startup in my hometown of Fresno, California for ~5 months. I was hired as part of a group of interns, but because of my relatively advanced skillset, within a couple weeks of onboarding I was filling a normal developer role & training my cohort.

I contributed to both the front (React) and back (Django Rest Framework) ends of this project, but the frontend was mine primarily.

We used the Ant Design framework for CSS & React Components, and leaned heavily on the Atomic Design methodology when we were composing UI.

The UI pictured below (and more) was my work, for instance.
